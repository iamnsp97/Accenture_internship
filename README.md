Accenture Data Analytics and Visualization Virtual Experience by Forage

I have completed a Data Analytics and Visualization Virtual Experience. 
I successfully completed practical tasks in the following areas:

*Task 1: Project Understanding*
I thoroughly understood the client's business problem and identified the necessary requirements for the project. This allowed me to focus on the specific tasks that a Data Analyst should address.

*Task 2: Data Cleaning & Modeling*
I performed data cleaning and modeling by integrating three files: content, reaction, and reaction types. I utilized formulas such as "VLOOKUP" and "SUMIF" to create a refined dataset that included relevant details. Furthermore, I determined the top 5 performing categories based on total scores.

*Task 3: Data Visualization & Storytelling*
I generated insightful visualizations and provided answers to significant data-related inquiries. These included identifying the count of unique categories, analyzing reactions for the most popular category, and pinpointing the month with the highest number of posts. Subsequently, I assembled these findings into a presentation to effectively convey my insights.

*Task 4: Present to the Client*
I delivered a virtual presentation to stakeholders, effectively communicating the results of my analysis and the insights I gained. This presentation equipped decision-makers with the necessary information to make informed choices for the business.

Overall, I have successfully managed to work with data, conduct data cleaning and modeling, develop meaningful visualizations, and present my findings to stakeholders. These experiences and skills demonstrate my proficiency as a Data Analyst. As I progress in my journey within the field of data analytics and visualization, I intend to build upon these achievements and continuously enhance my abilities.
